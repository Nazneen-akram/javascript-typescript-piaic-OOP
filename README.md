# Personality Checker

This is a Node.js script that helps determine your personality type based on your responses. You can enter your name and choose your personality type, and the script will provide the result.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. To start the personality checker, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node oop.js
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter your name and choose your personality type (1 for Extrovert, 2 for Introvert, or any other key for Mystery). The script will then provide your personality type based on your input.

## Customization

You can customize the personality types or add more options by modifying the code in the `oop.js` file. You can also change the way the results are displayed to suit your preferences.
